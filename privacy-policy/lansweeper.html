            2. What does "process personal data" mean?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Processing of personal data (hereinafter "data") includes any processing of data that can identify you as a natural person. This can include, for example, your contact details or order history. You can read more about which data exactly this involves in this Privacy Statement. The term "processing" is very broad and covers, among other things, the collection, storage, use of your data, or the sharing thereof with third parties. Sunday processes your personal data only in the context of its commercial activities as an enterprise.
        </p>

        <h2>
            3. To whom and when does this Privacy Statement apply?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Statement applies where Sunday is responsible for processing your data. This means that Sunday determines for what purposes (why) and by what means (how) your data is processed. However, when our customer decides on these factors, this Privacy Statement does not apply. At Sunday, in the course of our activities, we sometimes act as a data controller, and sometimes as a processor of our customer. Therefore, we briefly clarify below when, specifically, this Privacy Statement applies.
            <br><br>
            Sunday as a data controller: does apply
            With respect to the data of the persons listed below, Sunday acts as a data controller. This includes persons who belonged to these categories in the past (e.g. former customer), or persons who may belong to these categories in the future (e.g. potential customer).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Our customers, to whom we deliver our merchandise and provide our services;
            </li>
            <li>
                Our business partners, who assist us in operating our business;
            </li>
            <li>
                Other persons who would contact us, e.g. after visiting our website www.teamsunday.com, as long as we do not act as a mere processor with respect to your data.
            </li>
            <li>
                If any of the persons referred to above is a legal entity, we still process data of our contacts at these entities and the GDPR continues to apply.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Sunday as processor: not applicable
            <br>
            In specific circumstances, we act as our customer's processor. In fact, customers often engage us to produce merchandise and then deliver it directly to its employees, customers and business partners. In order to fulfill such orders, the customer will provide us with some data about you, such as your name, address details, and the correct size and any personalized features of the merchandise intended for you. In this case, we will process your data purely as a processor of our customer and in doing so we must at all times comply with our customer's instructions. After successful delivery of the order, we are contractually obligated to delete your data after a limited period of time. Since the customer bears ultimate responsibility for this processing, we refer you to our customer for any questions you may have in this regard regarding the way your data is processed. This situation will be relevant to you if you are an employee, customer or business partner of one of our customers and, on behalf of this customer, receive merchandise that has been produced by us.

            If you believe that we are improperly processing your data, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with your data protection supervisory authority. You can do this with the supervisory authority of the EEA member state where you usually reside, where you have your place of work or where the alleged infringement has taken place.

            11. How can you exercise your rights?
        </h2>
        <p>
            You can exercise the rights set forth in Section 10 simply by contacting us using the contact information set forth in the first heading of this Privacy Statement.
            <br><br>
            When you make a request to exercise your rights, if we have any doubts about your identity, we will ask you to verify it. In this case, we will request the transmission of documents that enable your identification beyond a reasonable doubt, such as a copy of the front of your identity card. We do this to prevent your data from falling into the wrong hands. It is sufficient for such a copy to show your name and date of birth clearly. You may then also delete the other data.
            <br><br>
            The exercise of your rights is in principle free of charge. However, where your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge you a reasonable fee in light of the administrative costs incurred by us. In the same case, however, we may choose not to act on your request. You will be informed of the reasons if we do so.
            <br><br>
            In any event, we will always inform you of the action taken on your request at the latest within 1 month of receipt. In the case of complex or frequent requests, this period may be extended to 3 months. In the latter case, you will be informed of the extension of the response period.

        <p>
            We reserve the right to change this Privacy Statement. The most recent version is available on our website at all times. The date on which this Privacy Statement was last amended can be found at the top of this page. In the event of a substantial change in the Privacy Statement, we will inform the data subjects on whom this may have an impact, directly if possible.
